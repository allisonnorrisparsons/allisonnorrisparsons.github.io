this is my portfolio site. i origonally was pulling insperation from a template that i found from w3schools. Im not completely satisfied with what i have but i am proud of the progress that ive made in this class because i walked in here knowing literally nothing.
I feel that when i walked into this project i had so really high expectesions. I wanted my website to have the same feel as the work that i have in my portfolio. I wanted it to be modern, sleak, and simple. I later found out that i shoulve lowerd my expectations so i dont let myself down so by the end i just wanted my website to be functional. I stuggled finding the right grid layout, the images after spending a abserd amount of time adjusting the size still arnt perfect and not all of my buttons are where i want them. I feel like i had to settle which is frustrating Im just impressed that i have a website in genral.
